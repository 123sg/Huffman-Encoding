HUFFMAN ENCODING - Data compression algorithm

Note: I initially wrote this program for my Design & Analysis of Algorithms in C++.  
I decided to do this program in Java for practice.

Instructions to run this program: Run the MainClass.java file. 
To run this program in Windows Command Prompt or the Mac Terminal:
Type the following to create class files:
javac HuffmanList.java
javac Node.java
javac MainClass.java
Lastly, type this to run the program:  java MainClass

Description:
This program performs Huffman Encoding. Probability-character pairs can be modified in the MainClass java file.
1. Probability-character pairs are insertion-sorted into a doubly linked list.
2. The full list of the probability-character sorted list is printed to the user.
3. A binary tree is created of this list and it is printed to the user.
4. Binary codes and binary code lengths are created for each leaf node of the binary tree. These results are printed to the user 
and the overall entropy.
